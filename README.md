# WifiPasswordAuditüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Segmentationfault


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Anjana A S- College of Engineeering Trivandrum
- Member 2: Kajal K - College of Engineering Trivandrum


### Project Description
A Flask-based API that takes any WiFi password and returns a witty, inappropriate roast under 150 characters to make users question their password choices.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People think their WiFi passwords are secure and clever‚Äîspoiler: they‚Äôre not. But who cares? Let‚Äôs roast them anyway.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI-powered roaster that mocks WiFi passwords with wild, witty insults‚Äîbecause roasting passwords is the new security audit.
